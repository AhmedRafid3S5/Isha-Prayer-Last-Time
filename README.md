# Isha-Prayer-Last-Time
A web scrapper tool to extract Isha prayer time and show last time of prayer

The code can extract prayer times from a website and display the time of Isha prayer and the last time for which prayer is valid.

Data is extracted from https://www.islamicfinder.org/world/bangladesh/1185241/dhaka-prayer-times/ and used to calculate the time when midnight starts.

The ruling behind the calculations : https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10125/what-is-the-time-of-isha-prayer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The website shows time based on location of the user, so to use the code, please visit the link for islamic finder and copy and paste the url for your location onto the code at line 8.

The last time for isha prayer is also calculated based on the time for a specific location/country.

Future updates:
1)Will implement a UI (Currently a console based application)
2)Will show how much time is left in real time
3)Show all other prayer times.
